#Smart Hearing Aid using Deep Neural Network
Recently after the deeplearning breakthrough in speech enhancement, more progress has been made and the field has become very improvable again and we became able to suppress more noise types. However, in some situations, noise could be more
important than speech like when having a fire alarm in building or siren ambulance while talking ...etc. In situations like these Hearing-impaired people could be put in lethal
situations. So, distinguishing between noise should be taken into consideration before suppressing them.
